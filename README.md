I am a proactive, hard-working and ambitious Makers Academy graduate with a background in science and marketing, looking for my first role as a software developer. I'm a great problem solver and experienced at communicating ideas to stakeholders and end users. I'm a fast learner and passionate about developing my existing skills and learning new ones. I'm currently enjoying working with React and NextJS, as well as learning testing frameworks like Enzyme. I've loved tech since a young age and I'm pursuing a new challenge as a developer as I wanted to join a rapidly changing, fast-paced industry, which gives me the chance to solve interesting problems on a daily basis.

# Skills

## Problem Solving

### Feedback from external code review

> You interpret test failures and errors really well and are able to glean the important information from the backtrace such as where the error occurred and what the difference is between the expected result and the actual result of your tests and did not spend too much time debugging.


## Time Management

I completed Makers Academy whilst continuing to work part-time running my small consulting business. This required me to be highly efficient at managing my time, in order to fulfil my responsibilities to clients whilst also completing the full-time bootcamp program.

## Fast Learner

The Makers bootcamp was a fast-paced learning experience, requiring the ability to pick up and implement new concepts and skills quickly. As one example, during one of our software engineering projects, we were given an additional challenge to develop a React frontend for our Ruby on Rails project. Having spent some time during the week completing the React intro course, I was able to turnaround a basic implementation overnight that fetched data from an API and displayed the data in a presentable fashion in React.

## Analytical

I come from a strong scientific background with two Masters degrees from Imperial College London. This time at Imperial laid a strong foundation for my analytical skills, requiring methodical recording and interpretation of gathered data to come to a factual conclusion. This is something I took into a more commercial environment as part of my marketing job, where looking at traffic, sales and revenue data became crucial to proving our worth, backing up our conclusions and planning future campaigns with clients.

## Communication

During my career in marketing, I've spent a lot of time working in client-facing roles, requiring me to communicate frequently, effectively and concisely, providing impactful reports & analysis, technical explanations, presenting new strategies, and (less frequently!) discussing why things haven't gone to plan and how we're going to get back on track. 

<!-- During the Maker's Academy bootcamp, I volunteered to run the end of week cohort retro, moderating the discussion and ensuring everyone was involved and contributing.  -->

<!-- ## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?

- 1. 


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->
